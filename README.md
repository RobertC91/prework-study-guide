# Prework Study Guide Web Application

## Description

This website was made with the purpose of compiling all of the different web development skills I learned and will continue to learn during the course of this Bootcamp. It will provide a reference to, if not a reminder of the different concepts and components that are required for such an undertaking. It was created using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript code which coincidentally make up not only the structure of the website, but as an added bonus, the content as well. Though it only begins to scratch the surface of the iceburg that is code, it serves as a launchpad for innovation and the promise of knowledge that is sure to come.


## Installation

There is no need to trouble youself with details about a concept that doesn't exist within this application.

## Usage

The use of this application is a modest one. To help fledgling coders organize the abundance of information that will surely be thrusted upon them. If you should take a glance at the DevTools you will notice the Javascript code running in the background, tirelessly running it's algorithms for the benefit of the users.

## Credits

Though I developed this myself, it would not have been possible without the guidance of the Bootcamp Staff which assembled the Modules that walked me through it's creation.
